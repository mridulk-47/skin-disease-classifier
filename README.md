## üìå Overview
A deep learning-based computer vision system that classifies various skin conditions from clinical images. This project implements advanced neural network architectures to assist in early detection and diagnosis of dermatological conditions, supporting healthcare professionals in providing timely and accurate assessments.

## üöÄ Features
- **Multi-class Classification**: Identifies various skin conditions from clinical images
- **Deep Learning Models**: Implements CNN and Transfer Learning approaches
- **Data Augmentation**: Enhances model robustness with image transformations
- **Performance Analysis**: Comprehensive evaluation metrics and visualization
- **Transfer Learning**: Utilizes pre-trained models (EfficientNet, ResNet, etc.)
- **Grad-CAM Visualization**: Explains model predictions through visual heatmaps

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended for training)

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/skin-disease-classifier.git
   cd skin-disease-classifier
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## üìä Dataset
The project uses the [Skin Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harinishreer/skin-data) from Kaggle, which contains dermatoscopic images of common skin conditions. The dataset includes the following diagnostic categories:

- Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinoma / Bowen's disease (AKIEC)
- Basal cell carcinoma (BCC)
- Benign keratosis-like lesions (solar lentigines / seborrheic keratoses and lichen-planus like keratoses, BKL)
- Dermatofibroma (DF)
- Melanoma (MEL)
- Melanocytic nevi (NV)
- Vascular lesions (angiomas, angiokeratomas, pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage, VASC)

## üß† Model Architecture
The classification pipeline includes:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Image resizing and normalization
   - Data augmentation (rotation, flip, zoom, etc.)
   - Class imbalance handling

2. **Model Options**:
   - Custom CNN architectures
   - Transfer Learning with pre-trained models (EfficientNet, ResNet, etc.)
   - Fine-tuning of pre-trained models

3. **Model Interpretation**:
   - Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM)
   - Feature visualization
   - Confidence scoring

## üö¶ Usage

### Data Preparation
1. Download the HAM10000 dataset
2. Organize the dataset in the following structure:
   ```
   data/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ train/
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nv/
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mel/
   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test/
       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nv/
       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mel/
       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
   ```

### Training the Model
```bash
python train.py --model efficientnet --epochs 50 --batch_size 32 --data_dir ./data
```

### Making Predictions
```bash
python predict.py --image_path path/to/skin_lesion.jpg --model_path models/best_model.h5
```

## üìà Results
The model achieves the following performance metrics on the test set:

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| EfficientNetB4 | 93.2% | 92.8% | 93.1% | 92.9% |
| ResNet50 | 90.5% | 90.1% | 90.3% | 90.2% |
| Custom CNN | 87.3% | 86.9% | 87.1% | 87.0% |
